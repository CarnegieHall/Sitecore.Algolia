# Sitecore search provider for Algolia

Algolia is a Hosted Search API that delivers instant and relevant results. Search Provider implements crawling part of index integration.

## Why another provider?

* Algolia is blazing fast, requires no maintenance and very little configuration
* Algolia has easy to use UI framework
* Provider built with Multitenancy available out of the box


## What you cannot do with this provider

Algolia is shyning in domain search like site or product catalog. It extremly fast and easy to use and configue. But there is price for that. It is not as flexible as other general purpose engine (Lucene). 

You cannot replace standard Sitecore Indexes like we do with Solr.
